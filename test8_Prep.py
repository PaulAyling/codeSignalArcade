# TEST 8

# THE PROBLEM
# Constraints
 - Regualr matrix
 - No negative costs

# Purpose
# calculate the total values of all the occupied rooms

# Definitions
an occupied room is a room where the room above does not have a value < 1

# input
# The matrix represents a building and the rows are floor
matrix = [[0, 1, 1, 2], 
          [0, 5, 0, 0], 
          [2, 0, 3, 3]]

# Output
sum(occupied rooms

# IDEAS
# loop through a row: if current_val>0: 

# Loop
#   above_row = matrix[rn]
#   current_row = matrix[rn+1]

final_cost = 0

# loop through rows
    # loop through rooms
# loop (rows)
# row = 0
  #loop (cols)
  # column = 0 
    if matrix[0][0] > 0:
      final_cost = final_cost + matrix[1][0]
    else:
      




# Top row special case
if row == 1:
  if cost< 0:
    occupied_room = true
# PLAN
row = 1
current_row = input_matrix[row]
row_length = len(current_row)
#[0, 5, 0, 0]
